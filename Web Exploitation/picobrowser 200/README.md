## Solution

The website given has a 'flag' button, which when clicked returns

```
You're not picobrowser! Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10_13_6) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/86.0.4240.198 Safari/537.36
```

I solved this mainly with prior knowledge. The website is pulling user agent data about your computer
and returning it. Since I'm not using Picobrowser, it is not going to give me the flag.

This could be solved either with BurpSuite or with developer tools in Firefox/Chrome.

I decided to keep things simple and use Chrome. By opening the hamburger menu in the
dev tools, you can select "more tools" and "network conditions." Here you can specify
a custom user agent, by using 'picobrowser' you're able to click the link and get the flag.
