The page http://jupiter.challenges.picoctf.org:44979/filter.php contains the filters, which
conveniently updates each round that you clear. The first filter is Round1: or

Using a simple username and password, the first page returns:

```
SELECT * FROM users WHERE username='k' AND password='k'
```

I tried a few things for the username including:

```
' OR 1=1 --
' OR '1'=1 --
```

However, none of this work. After struggling for a while, I considered the possibility that
there is probably an administrator account and thought it would be possible to use that.
After a couple of tries I found this worked since any spaces ended the string.

```
admin --
```

### Round 2

The second round filters are Round2: or and like = --

This went much quicker. Since they took away the -- option, I used the multi-line form of commenting
in sqlite.

```
admin'/*
```

### Round 3

Filters in Round3: or and = like > < --

This was a strange addition. Perhaps they didn't anticipate people using multi-line comments to bypass
these logins. The same bypass will work again.

```
admin'/*
```

### Round 4

Round4: or and = like > < -- admin

Sadly, I was not able to solve this, although I did get close. My first intuition was to somehow replace
the admin with a concatenated version. However, trying the basic

```
ad'||'min';
```

Did not work. After looking around for many other solutions, I came back to this trying many different
syntax forms. Eventually, I felt that I wasn't getting any closer and looked for someone else's writeup
so that I could make sure I was heading in the right direction and the solution was not something I
think I would have come up with, so I instead decided to learn from their process.

```
ad'/*a*/||/*a*/'min';
```

The reason I didn't figure this out is I didn't utilize one of the clues they gave us, which is
that the filters aren't always apparent and to view the raw hex responses. If I had done that, I would
have realized whitespace is also a filter. This solution is just using comments to bypass whitespace
and accomplish exactly what I had imagined the solution would be.

Regardless of whether or not I would have solved it, I did learn a couple new tricks to consider for
future sql injection challenges. Although given the clues, I believe that there is probably another
solution involving UNION that I didn't think of as well.

### Round 5

The same solution works here as the only additionally filter is UNION.

```
ad'/*a*/||/*a*/'min';
```

This gives us the flag! picoCTF{y0u_m4d3_1t_16f769e719ab9d3e310fd13dc1262ee1}
